# SQL-Exercises

## Overview  
This repository contains SQL scripts and exercises that cover a wide range of database operations, query optimizations, and data manipulations. The exercises focus on various SQL concepts, including database creation, data insertion, querying, and advanced SQL functionalities.  

## Topics Covered  

**Database Creation & Data Manipulation**  
- Created and managed relational databases.  
- Inserted data into tables using `INSERT INTO`.  
- Defined **foreign keys** to enforce referential integrity.  

**SQL Queries & Data Retrieval**  
- Wrote queries using:  
  - `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables.  
  - `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses to filter data.  
  - `GROUP BY` for data aggregation.  
  - Sorting results using `ORDER BY` (ascending & descending).  

**Advanced SQL Techniques**  
- Used **subqueries** to retrieve nested results.  
- Created **Common Table Expressions (CTE)** for better query readability and performance.  
- Worked with **temporary tables** to store intermediate results.  
- Implemented **transactions** (`BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`) to ensure data consistency.  
- Defined and managed **indexes** to optimize query performance.  

 **Stored Procedures, Functions & Triggers**  
- Created **stored procedures** to automate database operations.  
- Defined **functions** for reusable calculations and transformations.  
- Developed **triggers** to enforce business rules (e.g., automatic uppercase for last names, monitoring tax rate changes).  

### **Data Modification & Maintenance**  
- Updated records using `UPDATE`.  
- Deleted data securely using `DELETE`.  
- Implemented error handling mechanisms in procedures and triggers.
